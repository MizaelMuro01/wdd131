            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/profile.png" alt="Profile Image">
            <p>I'm Mizael Muro, and I'm from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. I enjoy learning and going fishing. I'm the
                youngest in a small family, with one sister and one brother. I really like watching good movies. I'm a
                student at two universities and I work selling auto parts. In my free time, I enjoy working on my own
                startup, which I plan to launch the MVP for in October 2025.</p>

            <p>Mexico, officially the United Mexican States, is a country in North America with a rich culture, one of
                the most appreciated cuisines in the world, and exceptional biodiversity. It is known for its history as
                the homeland of ancient civilizations, which left legacies in sites such as the Great Pyramid of
                Cholula, the largest pyramid in the world by volume. Globally, it is the 11th most populous country and
                holds a prominent position among emerging economies and in the number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
